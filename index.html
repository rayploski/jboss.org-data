<!-- Drools -->

<div id="droolsBox" class="displayBox">
<h1>Drools</h1>
<p>Drools is a rules engine implementation based on Charles Forgy's Rete algorithm tailored for the Java language. Adapting Rete to an object-oriented interface allows for more natural expression of business rules with regard to business objects. Drools is written in Java, but able to run on Java and .NET.  Drools is designed to allow pluggable language implementations. Currently, rules can be written in Java, MVEL, Python, and Groovy. Drools also provides for declarative programming and is flexible enough to match the semantics of the problem domain with domain specific languages (DSL) via XML using a schema defined for the problem domain. DSLs consist of XML elements and attributes that represent the problem domain.</p>

<div id="modeShapeJCRBox" class="displayBox">
<h1>ModeShape JCR</h1>
<p>ModeShape is an implementation that provides access to content stored in many different kinds of systems. A ModeShape repository isn't yet another silo of isolated information, but rather it's a JCR view of the information you already have in your environment: files systems, databases, other repositories, services, applications, etc.  To your applications, ModeShape looks and behaves like a regular JCR repository. Using the standard JCR API, applications can search, navigate, version, and listen for changes in the content.</p>

<div id="hibernateBox" class="displayBox">
<h1>Hibernate</h1>
<p>Hibernate is an Object/Relational Mapping solution for Java environments. The term Object/Relational Mapping refers to the technique of mapping data between an object model representation to a relational data model representation.  Hibernate takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables, and from Java data types to SQL data types. In addition, it provides data query and retrieval facilities. It can significantly reduce development time otherwise spent with manual data handling in SQL and JDBC.</p>

<h1>TX (Transactions)</h1>
<p>The JBoss Transaction Service (JBossTS) protects businesses from data corruption by guaranteeing complete, accurate business transactions for Java based applications (including those written for the JEE and EJB frameworks) thereby eliminating the risks and costs associated with time-consuming manual reconciliation following failures.</p>

<div id="hibernateSearchBox" class="displayBox">
<h1>Hibernate Search</h1>
<p>Hibernate Search brings the power of full text search engines to the persistence domain model by combining Hibernate Core with the capabilities of the Apache Lucene™ search engine.  Full text search engines like Apache Lucene™ are very powerful technologies to add efficient free text search capabilities to applications. However, Lucene suffers several mismatches when dealing with object domain models. Amongst other things indexes have to be kept up to date and mismatches between index structure and domain model as well as query mismatches have to be avoided.</p>

<h1>Infinispan</h1>
<p>
Infinispan is an extremely scalable, highly available data grid platform - 100% open source, and written in Java.  The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a Cache interface which extends java.util.Map.  It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.

<h1>JClouds</h1>
<p>
Jclouds is an open source library that helps you get started in the cloud and reuse your java and clojure development skills. Our api allows you freedom to use portable abstractions or cloud-specific features. We test support of 30 cloud providers and cloud software stacks, including Amazon, GoGrid, Ninefold, vCloud, OpenStack, and Azure.
